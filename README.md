# Coding Assignment 2
### DES-algorithm

#### By Abby Wheaton

### Program
This project reads in an input file, encrypts it with DES. It then
writes the encrypted input into a separate output file. 
From there, it reads back in the encrypted file, decrypts it, and writes the decrypted 
text to an output file. 

### Instructions to run program
In order to run the program, in a terminal with python in this directory type *python3 des.py [input_file]*. 
Where *[input_file]* is the input file you want the des algorithm to encrypt.
